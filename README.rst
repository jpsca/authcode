Authcode is a clean solution for both authentication and authorization of Python web applications. Briefly, authentication verifies a user is who they claim to be, and authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do.

It uses SQLAlchemy models and works out of the box with Flask, web.py and CherryPy (needs more testing), but can be adapted to use it with many other web frameworks.


Features
======================

-  Framework independent
-  Default but fully customizable User & Role models.
-  Ready to use authentication views and templates.
-  Password-reset tokens.
-  Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
-  Support multiple users models at the same time
-  Uses the most secure hash algorithms.
-  Auto-update of old password hashes.
-  Compatible with Python 2.7, 3.4+ and Pypy.


TODO
======================

* More documentation (always!)
    - English documentation
    - Automatic views: how to use and customize
    - Manual views

    - Examples:
        - Default
        - Twitter + login/password example
        - Mozilla Persona example
        - Login/Password + Mozilla Persona example

    - Tutorials, etc.

* Code:
    - Test setup functions for CherryPy, bottle, webpy, etc.
    - <Your web framework here> setup and tests
    - MultiAuth tests
