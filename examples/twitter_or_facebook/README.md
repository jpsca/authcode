# Signing in using Twitter or Facebook

This is an example on how you use AuthCode when the signing in is made via OAuth instead of the standard login/password views.

For the OAuth part I'm using the [flask_oauth](http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-OAuth/) library, but the principles are the same for any other OAuth library you might use.


##Â How to run locally

1. Create a virtualenv to contain the required python libraries (eg: `virtualenv env`)
   and activate it (eg: `source env/bin/activate`).

2. Install the required python libraries by doing
    
    `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`

3. Open the `settings.py` file.

    a) Go to:  https://dev.twitter.com/apps

       Make a new application and paste in the settings the key and the secret.

    b) Repeat for Facebook going here:  https://developers.facebook.com/apps

       Make a new application and paste in the settings the key and the secret.

4. Run the server with: `python main.py`

**Note**:  The `Procfile` and `runtime.txt` is for deploying on Heroku.
