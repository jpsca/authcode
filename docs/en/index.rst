Welcome to Authcode's documentation.  This documentation is divided into
different parts.  I recommend that you get started with
:ref:`installation` and then head over to the :ref:`quickstart`.
Common patterns are described in the :ref:`patterns` section.

Authcode is a clean solution for both authentication and authorization of Python web applications. Briefly, authentication verifies a user is who they claim to be, and authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do.

It uses SQLAlchemy models but does not depends of any specific web framework.

Features
--------

-  Framework independent
-  Uses the most secure hash algorithms.
-  Default but fully customizable User & Role models.
-  Ready to use authentication views and templates.
-  Auto-update of old password hashes.
-  Password-reset tokens.
-  Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
-  Compatible with Python 2.7, 3.4+ and Pypy.
